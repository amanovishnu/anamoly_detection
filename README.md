# KDD 99 Anomaly Detection Application

This is a Flask web application for predicting anomalies in the KDD 99 dataset using Decision Tree Classifier Model.

## Features

- Allows users to input features from the KDD 99 dataset and predict whether an instance is an anomaly or not.
- Provides a user-friendly interface for interacting with the prediction model.
- Utilizes a machine learning model trained on the KDD 99 dataset to make predictions.
- Supports real-time prediction with low latency.
